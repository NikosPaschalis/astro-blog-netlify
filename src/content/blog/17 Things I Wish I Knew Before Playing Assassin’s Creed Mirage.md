       # 17 Things I Wish I Knew Before Playing Assassin’s Creed Mirage

Ubisoft&#39;s latest installment in the long-running Assassin&#39;s Creed franchise, titled &quot;Assassin’s Creed Mirage,&quot; is now available on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. Unlike some recent entries in the series that featured expansive 200-hour RPG experiences, Mirage offers a more streamlined adventure that can be completed in under 25 hours for most players. Despite its shorter duration, the game returns the series to its stealthy roots. Here are some non-spoiler tips to help you excel in the game:

Standalone Adventure: Unlike previous Assassin&#39;s Creed games that relied heavily on the series&#39; lore, Mirage is designed as a standalone adventure. It offers a self-contained story that explains key elements as you progress, allowing both newcomers and seasoned fans to enjoy the game without prior knowledge.

Utilize Your Eagle: In the game, you&#39;ll be equipped with an eagle companion early on. This trusty sidekick helps you spot enemies, mark locations, find useful items, track objectives, and discover alternate routes. Make it a habit to use the eagle to avoid getting lost and stay one step ahead of your foes.

Eagle Vision: Just like other main characters in Assassin&#39;s Creed, Basim possesses the ability to activate Eagle Vision. This detective mode aids in identifying enemies, locating objects essential for quests, and finding hidden passages. Be sure to use it to your advantage.

Sync Points: Take the time to visit sync points scattered across the map, marked by an eagle icon. Synchronizing with these points allows you to fast travel to them later, saving you valuable time during your journey.

Embrace Stealth: In Mirage, it&#39;s often possible to find sneaky ways into enemy bases or camps that avoid direct confrontation. Consider looking for alternative entrances, pickpocketing guards for keys, or enlisting the help of mercenaries or nearby individuals to navigate stealthily.

Avoid Open Combat: Unlike recent Assassin&#39;s Creed titles, such as Valhalla or Origins, Mirage doesn&#39;t easily allow you to fight your way out of challenging situations. It&#39;s advisable to treat open combat against multiple foes as a last resort. Embrace your assassin&#39;s stealthy tactics, as the game supports this style of play.

Assassinate from Hiding Spots: When hidden in haystacks, piles of leaves, tents, or other concealed locations, remember that you can perform assassinations without alerting nearby enemies. Basim often automatically drags the victim&#39;s body into the hiding spot, concealing your actions.

Use Whistle Strategically: The whistle button serves not only to call your mount but also as a crucial stealth tool. Whistling can lure guards to investigate, and if you&#39;re hidden, you can eliminate them quietly. By luring guards one by one, you can maintain control over the situation.

Unlock Tools: As you progress through Mirage&#39;s campaign and gain levels, you&#39;ll unlock various tools that aid in stealth and combat. Consider prioritizing the smoke bomb, which can stun enemies and provide an opportunity for a quick escape or assassination.

Managing Notoriety: If you find yourself in a compromised situation, rush the person who spotted you and initiate an assassination before they can alert others. This approach can often prevent a full-on brawl.

Watch Your Notoriety: Keep an eye on your &quot;last known position,&quot; marked by a golden outline of your character, where guards last saw you. Hiding after being spotted will help you lose the pursuit. Notoriety can attract unwanted attention, so remove wanted posters and consult town criers to maintain a low profile.

Earning Rewards: Completing missions and exploring the game world will reward you with skill points, XP, resources for gear upgrades, and tokens that can be used during missions or to unlock special chests. These missions also offer enjoyable mini-narratives.

Locate Keys with Eagle Vision: When encountering locked doors or chests, use Eagle Vision to identify nearby keys. This can save you the trouble of searching blindly for a key.

Upgrade Your Gear: Don&#39;t forget to upgrade your equipment as you gather crafting items. Seek out blacksmiths and tailors in the game world to enhance your gear.

Sell Trinkets: Trinkets you obtain through pickpocketing and looting chests are valuable for selling. Visit merchants while replenishing your tools to make a profit. Maintaining a stock of tools, including smoke bombs, is crucial.

Main Story vs. Exploration: While exploring the game world is enticing, remember that Mirage allows you to continue playing after completing the main story. You can collect and finish side content at your own pace after the main narrative concludes.

&quot;Assassin’s Creed Mirage&quot; offers players a more compact but engaging experience, returning the franchise to its stealth-focused roots. These tips should help you navigate the game&#39;s challenges and make the most of your adventure in this intriguing addition to the Assassin&#39;s Creed series.
