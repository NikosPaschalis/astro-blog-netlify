      Publisher Playstack and developer Kumi Souls Games have revealed that their dark gothic Metroidvania game, &quot;The Last Faith,&quot; is set to launch on November 15. The game will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via Steam. A demo is currently accessible for PC users.

In &quot;The Last Faith,&quot; players will experience a blend of Metroidvania and Soulslike elements, offering challenging and precise combat mechanics. The game provides a wide array of custom execution moves and a diverse selection of weapons, spells, and firearms to choose from, empowering players to navigate their own path.

Central to the game is nonlinear exploration, featuring stunning pixel art that depicts a haunting gothic world. Players will explore snow-covered mountains and moonlit castles while discovering and upgrading a range of tools for combat and destruction.

Players will assume the role of Eryk, a character awakening with no memory of his recent past. As the story unfolds, it becomes a race against time as Eryk&#39;s mind and conscience deteriorate. His quest for salvation takes him on a cursed journey intertwined with ancient religions and divine forces.
