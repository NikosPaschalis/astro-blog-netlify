# ðŸŒ¿ Step Into the Emerald Dream: Hearthstone's Latest Expansion! ðŸŒ¿

Hey there, fellow Hearthstone enthusiasts! ðŸŽ® Have you heard the buzz? Blizzard just unveiled their upcoming expansion: **Into the Emerald Dream**. Launching on **March 25**, this set introduces **145 new cards** that promise to shake up the meta in exciting ways. Let's dive into what awaits us in this mystical realm. ðŸŒŒ

## New Keyword: Imbue

Classes like **Druid**, **Hunter**, **Mage**, **Paladin**, **Priest**, and **Shaman** are banding together to defend the World Tree. Their reward? A brand-new mechanic called **Imbue**. The first time you play an Imbue card, your hero power transforms into a unique, class-specific version. And guess what? Each subsequent Imbue play **powers up** your hero power even more! For instance, Hunters receive the **Blessing of the Wolf**:

## New Keyword: Dark Gifts

The Old Gods are up to no good, aiming to corrupt the Emerald Dream into a nightmare. They've introduced **Dark Gifts**, special minion enhancements available to **Death Knight**, **Demon Hunter**, **Rogue**, **Warlock**, and **Warrior** classes. When you **Discover** a minion, you can pair it with one of these ten Dark Gifts:

- **+3 Attack and Lifesteal**
- **+2/+2 and Elusive**
- **Costs (2) less, but has -2 Attack**
- **Charge**
- **Summon a 2/2 copy upon play**
- **Double Battlecries**
- **+4 Health and Taunt**
- **Reborn with full health and enchantments**
- **+4/+5; place this card on top of your deck**
- **Divine Shield and Windfury**

Strategically choosing the right combination can turn the tide in your favor.

## Massive Wild Gods

Ancient and formidable, the **Wild Gods** are here to aid in the battle for the World Tree. Each class gets its own **Legendary Wild God minion**. Some have already fallen to corruption, adding depth and intrigue to deck-building strategies.
