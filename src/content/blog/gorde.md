Build, Survive, and Uncover the Secrets of Gord: A Haunting Journey Awaits

Gord is a unique and atmospheric game that combines elements of city building, real-time strategy, survival, RPG, and horror. Set in a Slavic-inspired world, the game challenges players to keep a town of villagers alive amidst a monster-infested forest reminiscent of The Witcher. The game's grim and horrific atmosphere, accompanied by striking art and creature designs, creates a compelling and immersive experience. However, the dialogue and voice acting sometimes fall short, lacking the depth and authenticity needed to fully match the game's tone and setting.

In Gord, players must manage their settlement, assigning jobs to villagers while protecting them from dangers lurking outside the safety of the walls. Each villager has unique traits and aptitudes that affect their performance and job preferences. Health and sanity must be carefully monitored, and villagers need to be treated at specific locations to recover. Micromanagement plays a significant role, requiring players to give precise instructions and keep track of their villagers' abilities.

While the game's hands-on approach may feel a bit overwhelming at times, the strategy and depth it offers should appeal to fans of the genre. As the game progresses, more systems are introduced, potentially providing a more balanced and engaging experience. Gord's dark and strange world, along with its experimental gameplay, make it an intriguing title to watch out for. Prepare to embark on this grim Slavic adventure when Gord releases on August 8, 2023. [Link to Gord on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1351210/Gord/)
