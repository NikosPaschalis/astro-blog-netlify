      Palia will be making its way onto Nintendo Switch this holiday season, as announced in today’s Nintendo Direct. Singularity 6 has a new teaser with the announcement and answers a few questions about the upcoming Switch release (including how it relates to PC).

Today’s announcement and trailer were brief, so there’s not much to go on other than the cozy sim will indeed be multiplatform. The team confirmed the announcement on the Palia blog, along with some answers on how things will go.
There is a dedicated team working on adapting Palia to Nintendo Switch, so this isn’t taking away from PC development. It makes sense, given the interest in the game so far, and how the Switch has been a solid platform for cozy games like this. Plenty of people are asking questions about the PC release, especially since the Nintendo Direct announcement came with a release window. 

There are no updates on the PC release just yet, because the game is still in active alpha testing, with a huge stress test on the way in early July. With a window given for the Switch version, and a promise that “We will have more PC news to share soon”, it’s a good guess that a PC release window might not be too far off.

Palia will be free to play on Switch as well, and the team is dedicated to having the same support on both platforms. And yes, cross-platform is coming.
