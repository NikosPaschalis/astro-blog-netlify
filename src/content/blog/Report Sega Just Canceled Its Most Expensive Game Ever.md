       #Sega Just Canceled Its Most Expensive Game Ever
Sega&#39;s recently scrapped game, Hyenas, was reportedly the publisher&#39;s most expensive project ever, even surpassing the legendary Shenmue&#39;s budget. Developed by Creative Assembly, Hyenas was a multiplayer sci-fi space piracy FPS. However, it was canceled just 17 days after its latest beta, primarily due to a lack of clear direction and complications arising from an engine change mid-development. The game aimed for broad appeal, inspired by titles like Destiny and PUBG, and had substantial backing from Sega, with Japanese officials regularly visiting the UK office. Despite originally being planned as a premium title, it transitioned to a free-to-play model but faced difficulties during closed beta tests, leading to its eventual cancellation in September.
