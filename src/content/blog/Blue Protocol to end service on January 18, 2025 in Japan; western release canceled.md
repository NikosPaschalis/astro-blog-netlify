      # End of service?!

Blue Protocol, the free-to-play online action RPG, is officially shutting down in Japan on January 18, 2025, as announced by Bandai Namco. Originally launched for PC on June 14, 2023, in Japan, followed by PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series on December 13, 2023, the game’s journey will conclude early next year. Despite its impending closure, Blue Protocol will continue to receive content updates, including new storylines, until its final day.

The anticipated Western release of Blue Protocol, which was set to be published by Amazon Games, has also been officially canceled. Bandai Namco expressed disappointment in a recent statement, acknowledging their strong partnership with Amazon Games and their shared regret over not being able to bring the game to a global audience.

Currently, Blue Protocol remains available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC exclusively in Japan. Fans can catch the end-of-service announcement in the video below.
