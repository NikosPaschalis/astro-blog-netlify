       # Report: MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons launches in October
Polyscape, the developer of &quot;MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons,&quot; announced the game will leave Early Access and launch on Steam for PC in October at $12.99 or 1,500 yen with a launch discount. Language options include English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.

This real-time mystery dungeon-like action game draws inspiration from titles like &quot;Shiren the Wanderer&quot; and &quot;Tornekoâ€™s Great Adventure.&quot; Players control Mist, exploring dynamically generated &quot;Living Dungeons&quot; for rare items. Unique features include customizing skill builds from acquired equipment.

Mist&#39;s level resets when returning to town, risking item and money loss upon failure. Key features involve random dungeon exploration, real-time action, item variety, skill synergies, and rare item collection through &quot;Skill Books.&quot; Early Access included story stages, an endless mode, leaderboard, skills, equipment, consumables, boss battles, and a &quot;Memories Treasure&quot; collectible element.
Mist, the main character, is a treasure hunter searching for his missing father. He sells loot to Lupo, a wandering trader with a talent for dungeon item trading.

In summary, &quot;MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons&quot; is an action-packed roguelike game leaving Early Access, offering mystery dungeon exploration, real-time combat, and unique character-driven storytelling.
