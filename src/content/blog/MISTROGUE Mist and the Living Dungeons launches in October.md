       # Report: MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons launches in October

Polyscape, the developer of MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons, announced the game will leave Early Access and launch on Steam for PC in October at $12.99 or 1,500 yen with a launch discount. Language options include English, Japanese, Traditional Chinese, and Simplified Chinese.

This real-time mystery dungeon-like action game draws inspiration from titles like Shiren the Wanderer and Tornekoâ€™s Great Adventure. Players control Mist, exploring dynamically generated Living Dungeons for rare items. Unique features include customizing skill builds from acquired equipment.

Mist's level resets when returning to town, risking item and money loss upon failure. Key features involve random dungeon exploration, real-time action, item variety, skill synergies, and rare item collection through Skill Books. Early Access included story stages, an endless mode, leaderboard, skills, equipment, consumables, boss battles, and a Memories Treasure collectible element.
Mist, the main character, is a treasure hunter searching for his missing father. He sells loot to Lupo, a wandering trader with a talent for dungeon item trading.

In summary, MISTROGUE: Mist and the Living Dungeons is an action-packed roguelike game leaving Early Access, offering mystery dungeon exploration, real-time combat, and unique character-driven storytelling.
