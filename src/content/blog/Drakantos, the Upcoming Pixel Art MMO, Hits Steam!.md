A Pixel Art MMORPG with a Twist:
Drakantos is an upcoming free-to-play pixel art MMORPG slated for release on PC. While there&#39;s no official release date yet, I strongly recommend joining the official Discord to stay in the loop with all the latest news. Rest assured, I&#39;ll be posting an update as soon as I have more details. In the meantime, you might want to explore their developer diaries to get a glimpse of the remarkable progress they&#39;ve been making.

A World of Possibilities:
Drakantos boasts an enticing voice-acted storyline, dungeons, housing, raids, world events, and competitive PVPέΑΦessentially, everything you&#39;d expect from a traditional MMO, but presented in an adorable pixel art package. Notably, Drakantos takes a departure from the conventional class system. Instead, players will choose from pre-generated champions, similar to titles like Wayfinder or Warframe. At launch, there will be 21 playable heroes, with plans for more in the future. These champions can be obtained through a battle pass, available in both free and paid versions, as well as through in-game events.

While I&#39;ve been assured that the game won&#39;t fall into the pay-to-win trap, the presence of microtransactions in free games does raise some caution flags. Nevertheless, the developers I met were incredibly gracious and appeared genuinely passionate about their project, which has helped alleviate some of my reservations. At this stage, it&#39;s hard to make a final judgment, but I&#39;m certainly rooting for Drakantos and eagerly anticipating the chance to dive into this intriguing world. Don&#39;t forget to check out their Steam page and join their Discord for all the latest updates!
